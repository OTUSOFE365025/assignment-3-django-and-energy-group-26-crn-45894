# Assignment 3 – Django and Energy (Group 26 · CRN 45894)

Hi! This repository documents and implements my work for Assignment 3. Part 1 is a Django-based cash register demo, and Part 2 captures our team’s energy-efficiency architecture analysis. The README is written in my own words so the TA can see exactly what I built and how to verify it quickly.

---

## 🚀 What’s in this project?

- **Cash Register Demo (Django ORM):** A lightweight product lookup UI that lets me scan short UPC codes (`1001`…`1010`), append scanned items to a list, and watch the subtotal update instantly.
- **Seeding & Convenience Runner:** `main.py` seeds demo products and launches the dev server in one command so the reviewer doesn’t need to remember multiple steps.
- **Energy Efficiency Scenario:** Our group’s quality attribute scenario for a mobile health-tracking app, with tactics mapped to *Software Architecture in Practice* and the Design Concepts Catalog.

Stack: Python 3.13, Django 5.x, SQLite.

## 🧭 How to run my demo (TA fast track)

```powershell
# 1) Optional but recommended: create and activate a virtual environment
py -3 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

# 2) Install Django once inside the venv
pip install django

# 3) Seed products + start dev server (single command I prepared)
py -3 main.py
```

Open a browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`. Enter a short code like `1001` and press **Scan** repeatedly. The UI keeps a scrollable list of scanned items and updates the subtotal automatically. To stop the server, press `CTRL+C` in the terminal.

Alternate commands if you want full control:

```powershell
py -3 manage.py migrate
py -3 manage.py seed_products
py -3 manage.py runserver
```

## 🗂 Repo map (where everything lives)

| Path | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `settings.py` | Django configuration + SQLite database setup. |
| `manage.py` | Standard Django management entry point. |
| `main.py` | My convenience runner that seeds demo data and launches the dev server. |
| `db/models.py` | Defines the `Product` model (UPC, name, price) plus a toy `User`. |
| `db/views.py` | Contains the HTML view and JSON endpoint used by the scanning UI. |
| `db/templates/db/product_lookup.html` | The single-page UI for entering UPCs and showing the subtotal. |
| `db/management/commands/seed_products.py` | Populates the database with easy-to-type demo products. |
| `db/migrations/` | Schema history so `migrate` works predictably for graders. |

Navigation tips:
- ORM usage is easiest to see in `db/models.py` and the queries inside `db/views.py`.
- The JavaScript that handles scanning and subtotal updates lives inline in the template (look for the `<script>` block near the bottom of `product_lookup.html`).

## Part 1 – Cash Register System

**Description:**  
Designed and analyzed the architecture for a **Cash Register System** using the provided requirements document.  
The goal was to identify the appropriate **reference architecture** and outline how it meets the system’s needs.

**Key Decisions:**  
- Selected **Rich Client Application Architecture** as the most suitable choice.  
- This architecture allows the system to:  
  - Operate **offline or intermittently connected**, ensuring continued functionality without constant internet access.  
  - Provide a **fast, responsive interface** for immediate transactions.  
  - Interact directly with **local hardware** (printers, scanners, card readers).  
  - Synchronize with back-office servers when a connection is available.  
- The design leverages local data storage for reliability and performance while supporting synchronization for sales uploads and catalog updates.

**Outcome:**  
A well-structured rich-client model that balances **availability**, **performance**, and **maintainability**, aligning with retail point-of-sale requirements.

## Part 2 – Energy Efficiency (Quality Attribute Scenario)

**Description:**  
Defined a concrete **Energy Efficiency Quality Attribute Scenario** and identified relevant **architectural tactics** for a **mobile health-tracking application**.  
The analysis followed the *Energy Efficiency General Scenario* format and was submitted to Canvas as a PDF.

**Deliverables:**  
- Completed **Energy Efficiency Quality Attribute Table** (Source, Stimulus, Artifacts, Environment, Response, Response Measures).  
- Explained four key **tactics**:  
  1. **Adaptive Sampling / Duty Cycling**  
  2. **Batching and Deferred Execution**  
  3. **Energy-Aware Networking**  
  4. **Energy-Efficient UI Rendering**  
- Linked tactics to design concepts from *Software Architecture in Practice* and the *Design Concepts Catalog*.  
- Submitted the formatted document as a **PDF on Canvas**.
